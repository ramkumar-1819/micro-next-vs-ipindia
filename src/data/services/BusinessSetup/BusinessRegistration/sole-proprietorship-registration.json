          "question": "What businesses are commonly run as Sole Proprietorships?",
          "answer": "Most local businesses are run as sole proprietorships, from grocery stores to fast-food vendors, and even small traders and manufacturers. That is not to say that larger businesses cannot operate as sole proprietorships, they can! Jewellery shops are sole proprietors, but it is not recommended."

          "question": "Aside from a current account, is there any need for any other registration?",
          "answer": "This depends on the business you're in. It is compulsory for any business whose turnover in a financial year exceeds â‚¹20 lakhs (â‚¹10 lakhs in the case of North Eastern states) to get a GST registration. For businesses that are involved in selling goods or services to customers out of a commercial establishment, it is mandatory to register under Shops and Establishments Act."

          "question": "Is it cheaper to run an LLP than a private limited company?",
          "answer": "Yes, it is much cheaper to run an LLP than a <a href='https://vakilsearch.com/online-company-registration'><b>private limited company</b></a>. Mostly because compliances, such as an audit, apply to LLPs only after their turnover is sizable. Most LLPs spend about half as much as private limited companies, in their first year on registrations and compliance work."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I wish to convert from a sole proprietorship to a private limited company or partnership?",
          "answer": "The procedure involved is a little tedious, but it is possible. It is very common for sole proprietors to convert into partnerships or private limited companies at a later stage of their businesses."
