It&#8217;s an 8-digit unique identification number that&#8217;s good for life. The directors&#8217; information is stored in a database using DIN.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A DIN is unique to a person, therefore even if he is a director in two or more firms, he only needs one. And if he leaves one firm and joins another, the same DIN will apply.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The terms DIN and DPIN are now interchangeable. If a person has both a DIN and a DPIN, the DPIN will be cancelled, and the DIN will be used to appoint the person as a Designated Partner of a Limited Liability Partnership. If a person is given a DPIN, it must be used as a DIN under the Companies Act.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Takeaway</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every month, <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Vakilsearch</a> </strong></span>completes legal work for over 1000 firms and LLPs by combining our technological capabilities with the legal experience of our team.

Creditors and persons who have been directly damaged by the firm are unable to sue any of the business members for debts, whereas partners in an LLP are personally accountable, but only for their own fault. One partner will not be held liable for the activities of the other. This means that each partner is protected from accountability for the wrongdoings of the other.</li>\n<li>The LLC Memorandum and Articles of Association are the two documents that contain all of the information about the LLC, whereas the limited liability partnership agreement is the document that contains all of the information about the LLP.</li>\n<li>The suffix &#x2018;LLC&#x2019; must be added to the end of the name of a limited-liability corporation. Similarly, the limited liability partnership must have the letters &#x2018;LLP&#x2019; after its name.</li>\n<li>An LLC can be formed by a single person, who could be a businessperson or someone else, whereas an LLP must be formed by two or more people.</li>\n<li>Limited liability companies keep their books on an accrual basis, whereas limited liability partnerships can keep their books on either a cash or accrual basis.</li>\n<li>An LLC&#8217;s life is limited in the sense that if one of its members dies or leaves the company, it will dissolve. An LLP, on the other hand, has an unlimited succession.</li>\n<li>LLC is responsible for paying income tax, dividend distribution tax, and minimum alternate tax, whereas LLP is just responsible for paying income tax and alternate minimum tax.</li>\n<li>An LLC is a tightly held business vehicle that combines the components of a corporation and a partnership, whereas a <strong><a href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/llp-registration-india\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Limited Liability Partnership</a></strong> is a type of partnership in which partners&#8217; liability is restricted to the capital they contribute.</li>\n<li>An LLP&#8217;s internal governance structure is governed by the partnership agreement, whereas an LLC&#8217;s internal governance structure is governed by the applicable statutecheck here to more about: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>https://www.mca.gov.in/mcafoportal/showCheckLLPName.do</strong></span></li>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>LLC and LLP &#8211; COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENT</strong></h2>\n<p>In the case of an LLC, the annual cost of compliance can be rather high. It is required to consider balance sheet, profit and loss account, hold meetings, directors report and auditors report; make a declaration with regard to dividend and appoint auditors under the Companies Act, 1956 and the Rules made thereunder.</p>\n<p>Annual compliance in the case of an LLP consists of presentation of statement of account and solvency along with annual report under Section 34(2) and 35(1) of the LLP Act, respectively. In practice, the work and cost of compliance for LLPs is a fraction of that of a <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/online-company-registration\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">private limited business</a></strong></span>.</p>\n<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>\n<p>For the past decade, LLCs and LLPs have been popular because they offer their members a variety of possibilities. Because they combine the characteristics of a general partnership and a corporation, many people confuse these two for one and the same. Because of their structure and operating versatility these two business vehicles are ideal for <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/online-udyog-aadhaar-registration/about-msme-registration\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">small and medium businesses</a></strong></span>.</p>\n<p>Visit <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Vakilsearch</a></strong></span> to get further information!</p>\n<p><strong>Also, Read:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-register-a-llp-in-india/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Cost for LLP registration</a></strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/blog/documents-required-for-gst-registration-llp/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Document Required for GST Registration for LLP</a></strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/blog/how-much-does-it-cost-to-register-a-llp-in-india/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">LLP incorporation</a></strong></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><strong><a style=\"color: #0000ff;\" href=\"https://vakilsearch.com/blog/procedure-to-change-the-name-of-llp/\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\">Procedure to Change Name of LLP</a></strong></span></li>\n</ul>\n",
