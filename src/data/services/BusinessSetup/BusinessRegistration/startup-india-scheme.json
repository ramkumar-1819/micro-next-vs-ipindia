        {
          "question": "What kind of start-ups commonly register LLPs?",
          "answer": "Typically, only start-ups that will not be looking for venture capital funding register LLPs. This is because venture capitalists only invest in private and public limited companies."
        },
        {
          "question": "Is it cheaper to run an LLP than a private limited company?",
          "answer": "Yes, it is much cheaper to run an LLP than a private limited company, particularly in your early start-up days. This is because many compliances, such as an audit, apply to LLPs only after their turnover is sizable. Most LLPs spend about half as much as a private limited company in their first year on registrations and compliance work."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which industry is the best in India for a startup?",
          "answer": "According to the Economic Times, as of 2020, the top-earning businesses in India are from the financial services, transport and support services, aerospace, defence, and security services, technology services, and health and education services."
