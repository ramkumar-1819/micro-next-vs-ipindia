          "answer": "A limited liability partnership (LLP) is an entity that combines the characteristics of both a corporation and a sole proprietorship. It is a type of business entity that is popular in countries with strong personal property laws, such as India. A LLP is formed when two or more individuals each contribute cash and other assets to form an enterprise with the intention of sharing any losses that may occur. Unlike a regular corporation, which is subject to unlimited liabilities, an LLP limits its members' personal liability to their respective contributions to the partnership."
        },
        {
          "question": "Why Use an LLP Entity in India?",
          "answer": "LLPs are popular in India for several reasons. First, India has strong personal property laws, which make it easier for LLCs to form and operate. In addition, Indian law provides for limited liability partnerships in almost all commercial contexts, including business ventures, contracts, and intellectual property rights. This makes it easier for businesses to enter into agreements and conduct transactions without fear of financial loss or legal exposure."
        },
        {
          "question": "How Do I Form an LLP in India?",
          "answer": "To form an LLP in India, you first need to create a formal document called a memorandum of association (MOA). The MOA will describe the structure of your LLC, including the name of the organisation, the number of members it contains, and the terms under which it will operate. You will also need to register your LLP with local authorities. After you have completed these steps, you can start operating your organisation."

The report of the Expert Committee on Small Enterprises emphasised the benefits of a Limited Partnership Act once more in 1997, but in vain, claiming that it would improve the supply of finances and expertise. Later, with the Indian economy's potential growth rate increasing, it was believed in 2003 that the combination of entrepreneurship, knowledge, and risk capital would help the country's growth. Thus, the need for a limited liability partnership was highlighted, along with recommendations on how this new entity is supposed to operate. An LLP was chosen as an alternative corporate business entity, providing the new generation of entrepreneurs with a traditional partnership alternative. Thus, the Parliament passed the LLP Act in 2008, and it became effective in 2009."
