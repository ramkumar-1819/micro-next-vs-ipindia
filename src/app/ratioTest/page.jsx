            An LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) is a corporate business
            structure that offers its members the benefit of limited liability,
            just like a company. It allows partners to manage internal affairs
            based on mutually agreed-upon terms, similar to a partnership firm.
            Partners have reduced liabilities for any future debts incurred in the
            course of running the business.

        <p class="text-[16px] pb-3">

            An LLP combines features of both a corporate structure and a
            partnership firm, making it a hybrid entity that provides the best of
            both worlds. Partners are required to contribute to the LLP as
            specified in the LLP Agreement, and their contributions can take
            various forms, such as tangible or intangible assets, movable or
            immovable property, money, and cash.

            In an LLP, the Company itself is liable for any losses or debts

            LLP are not personally responsible for such financial obligations.

            As per Section 3 of the Limited Liability Partnership Act 2008 (LLP
            Act), an LLP is a corporate body established and registered under the
            Act. It exists as a distinct legal entity separate from its partners.

            Unlike a general partnership firm, a limited liability partnership has
            the advantage of perpetual succession. This means that even if one or
            more partners retire, become insolvent, suffer from mental incapacity,
            or pass away, the LLP can continue its operations. Additionally, the
            LLP has the capacity to enter into contracts and own property in its
            own name.

            Similar to corporations or companies, an LLP is recognised as a
            separate legal entity. It holds full liability for its assets and
            obligations. Moreover, the individual partners' liabilities are
            limited to their contributions to the LLP. As a result, the creditors
            of the LLP are not considered creditors of the individual partners.

            (Designated Partner Identification Number). If there are more than 2
            designated partners, the additional partners will need to obtain
            DPIN/DIN by filing DIR-3 after the incorporation process.

            designation of partners as required.|The certificate of incorporation
